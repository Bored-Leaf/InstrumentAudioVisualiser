# Read WAV, print info
Load the WAV file and print info:
- Channels
- SampleRate
- Bits Per sample
- TotalPCMFrameCount
- Audio Format
- Container Format

# Calculate something simple from WAV
- Basic Signal Analysis (RMS)
- Whatever is needed for waveform

# Draw the waveform
Learn OpenGL

# Your first FFT
- Implement FFT
	- Just print the values

# Implement multi threaded/real-time FFT
- Main thread - representing FFT (printing values for now) and waveform (rendering).
- Background thread - Readings input, calculates FFT, feeds main thread for rendering.
Want it to simulate real-time flow

# Rendering waveform and FFT with main thread
Render the FFT with main thread

# FFT Bars

# FFT Line Graph

# Spectrogram

# Real-time audio

# Read WAV, print info
# Calculate something simple from WAV
# Draw the waveform
Learn OpenGL
# Your first FFT
Just print the values

# Implement multi threaded/real-time FFT
Main thread - representing values
Background thread - calculating FFT
Have main thread still just printing results from the background thread.
Want it to simulate real-time flow
# Set up rendering with Main thread
Render the FFT with main thread
# FFT Bars
# FFT Line Graph
# Spectrogram

# Real-time audio
